# Background

Recently-ish I read [Viktor's  
weblog](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/ "Viktor's
weblog") on  
website discoverability. Moved, I wanted to participate in his idea of federated  
bookmarking. After all, I have a large bookmarks folder called "Links" filling  
up with random pages, so why not put it out there for everyone to see?

However, given how many there are and the frequency (~once a week) that I want  
to publish my bookmarks list, I wanted an easy way to take whatever  
Chrome/Firefox/Safari gives you when you hit "export bookmarks" and turn it into  
something [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo") could render.
