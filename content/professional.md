## Education

### Stanford University

I'm currently pursuing my BSc in computer science at Stanford University.
Officially, I'm in the class of 2026 with an expected graduation date of 2026.

## Work

### Tibex Technology

At Tibex Technology I served as a full stack software engineer. I worked with a
number of interesting technologies: [HCL
Domino](https://www.hcl-software.com/domino), Go, PowerBI, OpenAPI specs, and
Docker to name a few.

### Bustout Solutions

I spent a few years in highschool interning at Bustout Solutions under Tom
Benbow. I did a lot of pair programming, and worked primarily with frontend
technologies like Vue. For what ended up being the final project of the
internship, I made a baby name chooser that searched for the names that would
make the best domains.
